As I plan to write a tech blog, I focused more on blog themes with a dark mode. I evaluated the following: PaperMod - https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod (GitHub stars: 4432) Coder - https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder (GitHub stars: 2026) LoveIt - https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt (GitHub stars: 2279) After evaluating these themes, I decided to choose LoveIt because it provides both a dark and light theme, is more colorful, and fits my personality and writing style. On top of all, I love it! Winner: LoveIt - https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt (GitHub stars: 2279) It was time to install the theme.
